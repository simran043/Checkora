# Web Security Audit & Enhancement Plan 🛡️

## Audit Summary
- **Target:** checkora.vercel.app
- **Initial Grade:** B
- **Goal:** A+

## Identified Vulnerabilities
The following headers are missing and should be implemented to protect the application:

### 1. Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
**Problem:** The site is currently vulnerable to XSS (script injection) because no CSP is defined.
**Fix:** Implement a CSP to restrict script execution to trusted sources only.

### 2. Permissions-Policy
**Problem:** Browser features (like camera, microphone, and geolocation) are not restricted, posing a minor privacy risk.
**Fix:** Explicitly disable unused hardware features in the response headers.

## Recommendation
By implementing these headers in the Django `settings.py`, the project will move to a Grade A+ security rating and follow industry best practices.

## Implementation Guide for Django (`settings.py`)

To resolve the identified gaps, the following configurations should be added to the project's `settings.py` file:

### 1. Enabling Basic Security Headers
```python
# Security Header Settings
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000  # 1 year
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
```

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
*Note: This requires the `django-csp` package.*
```python
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", "'unsafe-inline'")
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'",)
```

### 3. Permissions Policy
```python
# To be set via middleware or server configuration
# Header: Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```
